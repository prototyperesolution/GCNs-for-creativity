As there are 4 experimental conditions, there are 4 variants of the program (ipynb notebook) here.
Each condition creates a new directory wherein model weights are saved. This can be altered in the marked section of the .ipynb notebook.
Further details on the workings of this project can be found on prototyperesolution.blogspot.com
